The latest version of the package can be installed using:

```

```

## Developer's installation (optional)
For development work, `AtomicEmbeddings` can eb installed from a copy of the [source repository](https://github.com/WMD-group/Atomic_Embeddings.git); this is preferred if using experimental code branches.

To clone the project from Github and make a local installation:

```
git clone https://github.com/WMD-group/Atomic_Embeddings.git
cd Atomic_Embeddings
pip install --user -e .
``` 
With `-e`, pip will create links to the source folder so that the changes to the code will be reflected on the PATH.
