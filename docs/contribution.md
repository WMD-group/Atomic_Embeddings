## Bug reports, feature requests and questions

Please use the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/WMD-group/ElementEmbeddings/issues) to report bugs or request features in the first instance. Contributions are always welcome. 

## Code contributions

We are always looking for ways to make `ElementEmbeddings` better and a more useful to a wider community. For making contributions, use the ["Fork and Pull"](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) workflow to make contributions and stick as closely as possible to the following:

* Code style should comply with [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) where possible. [Google's house style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) is also helpful, including a good model for docstrings.
* Please use comments liberally when adding nontrivial features, and take the chance to clean up other people's code while looking at it.
* Add tests wherever possible, and use the test suite to check if you broke anything.
