Atomic_Embeddings
====

The **Atomic Embeddings** package provides high-level tools for analysing atomic 
embeddings data. This primarily involves visualising the correlation between 
atomic embeddings using a variety of different statistical measures.

Motivation
--------

Machine learning approaches for materials informatics have become increasingly 
common wihtin the field. Some of these involve the use of deep learning 
algorithms where the representation of the elements is learned by the model 
rather than specified by the user of the model. While an important goal of 
machine learning training is to minimise the chosen error function to make more 
accurate predictions, it is also important for us material scientists to be able 
to interpret these models. As such, we aim to develop a framework which 
standardises the evaluation of atomic embeddings learnt from deep learning models 
and determine to develop the means to compare different sets of embedding data.

Getting started
--------
Atomic_Embeddings's main feature, the AtomicEmbedding class is accessible by 
importing the class.

Installation
--------
The package can be installed by cloning the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/WMD-group/Atomic_Embeddings.git
cd Atomic_Embeddings
pip install .
```
